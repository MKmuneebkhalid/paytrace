# Steps to get your SendGrid API Key:
# 1. Sign up for free at https://sendgrid.com (12,000 emails/month free)
# 2. Go to Settings → API Keys
# 3. Click "Create API Key"
# 4. Give it a name like "PayTrace App"
# 5. Choose "Full Access" or "Restricted Access" with Mail Send permissions
# 6. Copy the API key (starts with "SG.") - you won't see it again!
# 7. Paste it in SENDGRID_API_KEY below
#
# For EMAIL_FROM:
# - This is the fallback "from" email when owner email is not available
# - When payment links are created via Zoho webhook, emails will come from the account owner
# - Use a verified sender email (verify in SendGrid dashboard)
# - Format: "Your Company Name <verified-email@yourdomain.com>"
# - For free tier, you must verify the sender email first
# 
# IMPORTANT: For Zoho webhook integration
# - Emails will be sent from the account owner's email (requests.owner_email from Zoho)
# - You must verify ALL account owner emails in SendGrid beforehand
# - Go to SendGrid → Settings → Sender Authentication → Verify Single Sender
# - Add each team member's email who will be sending Zoho Sign documents
