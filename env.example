# Server Configuration

# App URL - Used for generating payment links
# Change this to your production domain when deploying
APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Email Configuration (Required for sending payment link emails)
# 
# Using Resend for reliable email delivery (recommended for production)
# 
# Steps to get your Resend API Key:
# 1. Sign up for free at https://resend.com (100 emails/day free, 3,000/month on paid)
# 2. Go to API Keys in the dashboard
# 3. Click "Create API Key"
# 4. Give it a name like "PayTrace App"
# 5. Copy the API key (starts with "re_") - you won't see it again!
# 6. Paste it in RESEND_API_KEY below
#
# For EMAIL_FROM:
# - This is the fallback "from" email when owner email is not available
# - When payment links are created via Zoho webhook, emails will come from the account owner
# - For TESTING: Use "onboarding@resend.dev" (no verification needed!)
# - For PRODUCTION: Use your own domain email (requires domain verification in Resend)
# - Format: "Your Company Name <email@yourdomain.com>"
# 
# IMPORTANT: For Zoho webhook integration
# - Emails will be sent from the account owner's email (requests.owner_email from Zoho)
# - For production, you'll need to verify your domain in Resend
# - Domain verification is much simpler than per-email verification
# - Add DNS records once, and any email @yourdomain.com can send
#

# Comma-separated list of emails to receive card-saved notifications
# These emails will receive notifications in addition to the owner email from webhook
